                    </div>
                    <p class="mb-30">In this project, I have decided to do the software for gaming mouse inspired by synapse software developed by Razer. The reason I have chosen this software is because of my own experience using this application. I find it very confusing and hard to use. So I decided to make my own.</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">I have researched for other similar software such as Ventus Ambidextrous Gaming Mouse, Logitech Gaming Software, Corsair Software, CM Storm application to compare them and know what they have in common. The first thing the I noticed was they all have the key binds, Profile for different games and calibration so I decided to do those for this assessment.</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">Looking at other software like the Ventus one and realizing that they have used a very bright colours and not really good to look at in the dark as it will pretty much light up the whole room, while CM Storm Software got a lot of numbers and it's kind of overwhelming when you look at it and if you don't know what the numbers are for. 
                      So I decided to make my design as simple as possible and go for the minimalistic look as you can see on my wireframe.</p>

                    <p class="mb-30">Since I have decided to go for my own design for the mouse, I made up my own company and decided to make my own logo. I really like the way the logo of Avengers goes, it gives me the futuristic look and it is perfect for my design since im building a software for a technology. But then I realize that they only used one letter for the logo while I have 3 letters and it will look very crowded if I put them all in one circle like the avengers logo. So I decided to drop that idea and made my own original one.</p>

                    <p class="mb-30">I made the logo light blue to contrast with the color of the light coming from the mouse, I made sure to color the whole circle light blue and made the colour dominating to establish the main colour of the company. I also use a darker colour as a background of the mouse image because I dont want to end up looking like Ventus. I also used lighter blue for the profile on my main page to contrast with the Heading (Profile) as it would relate to them. I also used the same touch of colour for my bar on the second page and the third page to show that they are all related to the logo. On the Calibration page, I made the border of the box light blue because it doesn't look that much related to the logo with just the blue bar in it unlike the main page that has the letters as blue and the performance page that has two bars in it. I also went for grey and black colour as background because its very easy to look at.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-30">I also use Photoshop to copy a mouse from the internet, select it using the wand and cut it then paste it to a new file and making sure that the background is transparent and saved it as png to keep its transparency. then I pasted it to illustrator and put it on top of the layers. For the small mouse image on key binds, I made a rectangle that is almost as big as the mouse then just added anchor points and put it around the border of the mouse to imitate its shape. Then I colour it with white so that if I want to emphasize any of the button, I can just use black to stand out.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-30">The title of the page was originaly rectangle but it looks pretty boring so I decided to cut some of the sides but then I realize that its weird looking for a title so I decided to add three little slanted rectangle to make contrasting and the repetition is perfect as well. I used poor richard for my font on most of it because it gives me a clean and nice stroke for each letter and its really simple and looks a little bit futuristic too.</p>

                    <p class="mb-30">I used rectangle for the tabs and just move the points on the side to make it round, I did this because I dont want my software to look really pointy and boxy. For the slide bar, I made sure to use the same colour as the logo for it to relate to the company, since its just a really thin line, its perfect to make it consistent because it wouldnt hurt the software much, it would never give us the impression of being "too bright" or "too much colour".</p>

                    <p class="mb-30">On my button, I was thinking of using my main colour as its background at first but then realized that its too much for the software so I decided to leave it just grey it self. While the background of each profile is not just plain grey but a gradient of black and grey, it compliments the background of the box and the actual background of the software very well. The reason why I didn't put this on the KEY BINDS button is that it would look like its a shiny metal for every button. I just like the contrast between the background of that button and the colour of the font.</p>
