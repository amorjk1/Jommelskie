                    <div class="journal-txt">
                    </div>

                    <p class="mb-30">This animation is about a student who went to school but when he got there, he saw an empty class room and it says that theres no class on that day. so he went back hom and thats the end of the animation.</p>

                    <p class="mb-30">this story is inspired by my own story event, I find it really funny and used that as my story. </p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-30">I used most of the school building using a rectangle tool as I find it easy to use. I also had to look up some pictures from google on how to draw a building as I am not that good at imagining things.I used the free transform tool and made it bigger to make the "zooming" effect on the shot. I used the brown colour to make the building kinda old and put some cracks on it too.</p>

                    <p class="mb-30">on the second scene, I used multiple layers for the face. I made the eye ball on a different layer so that I can make it as a symbol and put use it for my motion tween. I just had to split the time that I wanted to on that scene so that the eye ball will go back to the other side.</p>

                    <p class="mb-30">for my third scene, I used the same model from the previous scene but I deleted the face to make it look like its facing the other way then I just resize the model using free transform tool.</p>

                    <p class="mb-30">for the next scene, I also used the same model from second scene and instead of using the eyes and mouth, I made another one that looks like a sad face. I also made a teardrop using oval tool and just dragged one part going down to make a tear drop looking shape. I put that as another motion tween to make it go run down the face.</p>

                    <p class="mb-30">my fifth scene is pretty much the same as the third scene as I want to show that the character is leaving the classroom. I made the whole character a symbol and put that into a motion tween and I just pulled it out of the frame.</p>

                    <p class="mb-30">The shot from outside the school is also the same as the first one but instead of zooming in, I just used the same size and made some clouds. I made 2 different clouds from the layer section, then I made them both symbols and decided to make the other one slower than the other one to make it more realistic. 
                      </p>

                    <p class="mb-30">
                      The side view shot is quite tricky for me because I used a shape tween and motion tween at the same time. Because I missed alot of classes, I had to watch some vidoes online and most of the videos are on flash which is the older version of animate cc. But I managed to get it working in the end.</p>

                    <p class="mb-30">For the side view scene walking around the tree, its pretty much the same as the one I used from the previous shot, same model except its bigger and I just tweak the shape tween a little bit. </p>

                    <p class="mb-30">for the last scene, I used the same clouds that I used for the outside shot then used the same model too for the character. </p>
